# Study Up

## Product Vision
Study Up is an educational platform that is designed to help users learn different subjects such as math, science, and history. Inspired by Duolingo, Study Up allows users to either learn a subject based on a specific grade level or pick individual topics to learn.
Similar to Duolingo, users will have to complete nodes to learn and master a subject. Each node will provide different types of questions, such as sort response or multiple choice, that must completed. Each time the user gets a question wrong, they will be shown the solution as well as the steps to reach that solution. At the end each topic, there will be an option that allows the users to take a test to check their understanding. Upon completion, the user is able to continue and access more advanced learning.

So far, there are only three subjects that the user can choose - Math, Science, and History. Once the user has clicked on the subject of their choice, they will be presented with a few courses that they can learn from the choosen subject. Once they picked a course, they will then see a topics that they can learn from that course.
Prototype features very basic subject selection.
